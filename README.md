# VirsabiPublicFiles
This repo recieves the pacakge.json file from every release on VirsabiRepoDevelopment. This is because we use the information in the package file both in Unity to determine if we need to upgrade our tools, and in our readme badges. This information is easiest to access if public in this repo and the information is not of sensitive nature.
